          Technology has always been present in my family environment since I was born. On the one hand, I have Japanese descent ðŸŽŽ, who are very involved in new technologies. On the other hand, my grandfather and father are electronic engineers, so technology has been part of my life since always.

          <Text fontSize="l"  color="#6B7379" marginBottom={5}>
          Thanks to this influence, I developed a great interest in the use and application of technology.

          During my school years, I obtained multiple certifications endorsed by UTN in the field of technology. However, later on, my interest turned towards the artistic and creative field, and I dedicated myself to studying music, musical instruments, dubbing, musical theater, and vocal health. I graduated as a speech therapist from UBA and, in parallel, took multiple design courses, including tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Procreate, and Photoshop ðŸŽ¨.

          As my circle of friends expanded to include programmers and computer engineers, my interest in the subject grew ðŸ’». Finally, at the end of 2022, I took the courage and completed the Henry pre-entry course to test my programming skills. Now, I am excited to continue learning and developing my skills as a Full Stack developer.

          In addition, I have a great interest in the field of design, especially in creating attractive and functional user interfaces, and in user experience.
